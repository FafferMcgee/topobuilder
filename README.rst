TopoBuilder
===========

*TopoBuilder* is a **Python2 only** library for the construction of tailored protein scaffolds around
functional structural motifs of interest.

Provided a PDB-formatted file from the **Protein Data Bank** (PDB_) with the functional motif of interest
and a **JSON** configuration file with the expected topology, *TopoBuilder* will generate all the necessary
files to execute the FunFolDes_ protocol of the Rosetta_ suite in a non-mpi, SLURM-managed cluster.

Installation
------------

*TopoBuilder* can be installed for **Python 2.7** from the git repository through pip:

```
pip install https://github.com/lpdi-epfl/topobuilder/archive/v1.0.zip
```

Execute
-------

To see all the options to execute *TopoBuilder*, write:

```
python -m topobuilder -h
```

*TopoBuilder* builds the topologies by initially placing secondary structures in a X-Z grid,
where Z represents depth and X represents width. The Y axis (which is high) can also be specified,
but it is not necessary. Initially, the protocol, given a position and number of secondary structures
(architecture), will try all posible connectivities (topologies) fitting that architecture as long as
the motif allows it (multi-segment motifs, by their nature, limit combinatorial possibilities).
The best way to explain how to work with *TopoBuilder* is through an example.
Let's say on wants to build a topology carrying the 4e10 epitope from HIV (2FX7_).

To simplify, we will try a **4-helix bundle**. For that, we would write a **JSON** input such as:

```
{
  "config": {
    "name": "4hb"
  },
  "layers" : [
    [
      { "type" : "H",
        "length" : 16,
      },
      { "type" : "H",
        "length" : 16,
      }
    ],
    [
      { "type" : "H",
        "ref": "2fx7.helix"
      },
      { "type" : "H",
        "length" : 16,
      }
    ]
  ],
  "motifs": [
    {
      "id": "2fx7",
      "pdbfile": "2fx7.pdb",
      "chain": "P",
      "segments": [
        {
          "ini": 671,
          "end": 686,
          "id": "helix"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`config`, `layers` and `motifs` are the top, mandatory fields.

`config`
********

The only mandatory parameter here is `name`, which identifies the full execution.
Other parameters that can be provided but have default values are:

* `default_z`: Default depth between secondary structure layers. (default=11)
* `default_x_h`: Default width between helices in the same layer. (default=11)
* `default_x_e`: Default width between beta strands in the same layer. (default=5)
* `link_dist`: Defalut distance between secondary structure to consider connecting them.
* `connectivity`: If provided, create a given connectivity instead of trying all possible.
Connectivity should be defined as a string in FORM_ format, in which each secondary structure
is defined by `<layer_id><layer_position><SSE_type>`; where `<layer_id>` is an uppercase letter
starting in A, `<layer_position>` is an integer starting in 1 and `<SSE_type>` is either (H) helix
or (E) beta. We will see how this looks like in the results from the example execution.
* `l_linkers`: If provided as a list of numbers with length=number of structures - 1, it will
setup those as the loop lengths, otherwise the protocol will calculate the most likely lengths for the loops.
